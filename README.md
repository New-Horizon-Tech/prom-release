# prom-release

## Introduction

**prom-release** is a powerful release management tool designed to simplify and streamline the deployment lifecycle for Kubernetes environments. Managing multiple services, environments, and releases within a Kubernetes cluster can quickly become complex and error-prone. prom-release addresses these challenges by providing a clear, automated, and auditable workflow for building, tracking, and promoting releases across all your environments.

With prom-release, you can easily keep track of every release you build for every service you run. The tool maintains a complete history of releases, allowing you to see exactly which versions are deployed to each environment at any point in time. By separating release and deployment management from your source code and running clusters, prom-release enables you to automate your build pipelines to publish YAML files and artifacts into a centralized repository of releases.

From there, you can manage promotions, rollbacks, and environment synchronization with simple commands. prom-release supports multiple builds and environments, making it effortless for your build scripts to create new releases and for your operations team to promote those releases to any environment. Keeping environments aligned, rolling back to previous versions, and auditing deployment history becomes trivial.

Whether youâ€™re running a single service or a complex microservices architecture, prom-release gives you the control and visibility you need to manage releases and deployments with confidence.
